# Bits of Advice

Bits of Advice is a site that displays bits of advice written by my father. Originally posted in a series of static blog posts ([here](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/), [here](https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/), and [here](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/)), this site revamps the presentation of the advice and makes it possible to share indiviual bits of advice, allows visitors to "favorite" advice with a starring mechanism, and allows them to sort advice by length to find the pithiest and most poignant pieces.

I grew up around these pieces of advice. They were not all said explicity, but they were always in the air. I have used them more than once to at least reflect on decision points in my life, or at most in-the-moment use them to dictate a decision. I made this site both for myself -- to get aquainted with the advice, and develop a sort of shrine around it -- and for others to discover for themselves and find something that speaks to them. Please enjoy!
